This is a personal challenge.

## Description
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku), Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. In classic sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.

### Sudoku Rules
- Each row must contain every number from 1 to 9 exactly once.
- Each column, similarly, needs one of every number from 1 to 9.
- Each 3x3 ‘region’ needs to follow the same 1–9 pattern.
