# Combinatoric Selections
Challenge taken from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/problem=53).

## Description
There are exactly ten ways of selecting three from five, 12345:

`123, 124, 125, 134, 135, 145, 234, 235, 245, and 345`

In combinatorics, we use the notation, ![](1.PNG?raw=true)

In general, ![](2.PNG?raw=true), where `r <= n, n! = n x (n - 1) x ... x 3 x 2 x 1`, and `0! = 1`.

It is not until `n = 23`, that a value exceeds one-million: ![](3.PNG?raw=true)

How many, not necessarily distinct, values of ![](4.PNG?raw=true) for `1 <= n <= 100`, are greater than one-million?
